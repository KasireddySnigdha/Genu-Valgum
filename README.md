# Genu-Valgum

Knock knees, also known as genu valgum, is a type of knee alignment seen when a child (or adult) stands up straight with their knees together, but their feet and ankles stay apart. The opposite type of alignment, called bow legs (genu varum), is when someone stands with their feet and ankles together, and there is a gap between the knees.



Steps :
1. Collect a dataset of images/videos with varying degrees of genu valgum.
2. Preprocess the data by resizing, cropping, and normalizing the images/videos.
3. Estimate knee alignment using computer vision techniques like edge detection or contour analysis.
4. Split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.
5. Train a machine learning model, such as a CNN, on the dataset.
6. Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
